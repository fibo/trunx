# trunx

> super Saiyan react components, son of awesome [Bulma]

## Components

See components storybook [here](http://g14n.info/trunx).

## Installation

**NOTA BENE**: this package is at an early stage development.

[React] v16 is required as a peer dependency. With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) do

```bash
npm install react
npm install trunx
```

## Motivation

I really like [Bulma] CSS framework and I am using it to build an URL
shortener: [Go7]!
I love [React] and I am also a Dragon Ball fan.
So, summing all, I am creating this component library. I hope you enjoy it!

> Trunks (Japanese: トランクス Hepburn: Torankusu) is a fictional character in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.

I remember when I was reading the comics and Trunks arrived from the future. He was really powerful and could defeat Freezer in few seconds. One of the
best twists of the entire series, in my opinion.

## Development

```bash
npm run storybook
